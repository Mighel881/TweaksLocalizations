# TweaksLocalizations
Here is the place to translate all my tweaks!

## How can I translate?
It is very simple:
- Fork this repo
- Choose your tweak(s)
- If your language already exists
    - You can check it and/or improve it!
- If it does not exist
    - Copy the `base.lproj` folder
    - Rename `base` with [your lproj id](https://gist.github.com/Josantonius/b455e315bc7f790d14b136d61d9ae469) (e.g.: `fr` for French)
    - Translate each file by changing the text after each `=`
- Make a Pull Request
- [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1232212278713430021) to get your credit in my tweak(s) and here
- **That's it!**

Thank you!

**Note:** It is highly recommended to download the concerned tweak to translate it better!
